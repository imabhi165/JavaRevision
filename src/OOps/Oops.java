        // Object is a real entity created from a class 
       //Classes :  classes are the blueprint.
       //Example : If car is a class : then  bmw,martuti suzuki,etc are the object of that class.
       //There are 4 pillars of the OOPS concepts :
       //1.Encapsulation : -> 
       //2.Abstraction
       //3.Inheritence : Inheritance is the process where one class (child/subclass) inherits the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class (parent/superclass).
       //4.polymorphism : polymorphism means "Many forms"
